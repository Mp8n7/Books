## Lyrics
```text
[Intro | Fast Drum Fill | Feedback]
Yeah!
Oh god!
It's gone! It's all gone!
1, 2, 3, 4!

[Verse 1 | Anxious | Staccato]
I saw the green candle, I thought it was time
To leverage my savings, to commit a crime
Against my own wallet, against common sense
I put it on 100x, the tension's immense!

[Pre-Chorus | Building Tension]
Bogdanoff is watching, he's holding the phone
"He bought?" he asks, in that terrible tone
"Dump it," he whispers, and turns off the light
My screen turns to crimson, a terrible sight!

[Chorus | Shouty | Anthemic]
I'm liquidated! On Binance again!
I lost all my money, I lost all my zen!
The margin call's calling, it's ringing my bell
I'm sliding down candles, straight into hell!
Liquidated! No BNB left!
This feels like a rugpull, it feels like a theft!

[Verse 2 | Fast | Chaotic]
I checked the RSI, I drew all the lines
I ignored the warnings, ignored all the signs
"It's just a correction!" I screamed at the screen
But the liquidation price was part of the scene!
Wojak is crying, he looks just like me
Holding heavy bags of a dead NFT!

[Pre-Chorus | Building Tension]
"He sold?" says the voice from the depths of the dark
"Pump it," he chuckles, waiting for the spark
My position is closed, my balance is zero
I'm not a trader, I'm not a hero!

[Chorus | Shouty | Anthemic]
I'm liquidated! On Binance again!
I lost all my money, I lost all my zen!
The margin call's calling, it's ringing my bell
I'm sliding down candles, straight into hell!
Liquidated! No BNB left!
This feels like a rugpull, it feels like a theft!

[Bridge | Half-Time | Heavy]
(Palm muted chugging)
Why did I do it?
Why did I click?
This market is rigged!
This market is sick!
(Tempo speeds up)
CZ is laughing!
Musk is tweeting!
My heart is stopping!
My account is bleeding!

[Guitar Solo | Fast | Sloppy]

[Chorus | Maximum Energy]
I'm liquidated! On Binance again!
I lost all my money, I lost all my zen!
The margin call's calling, it's ringing my bell
I'm sliding down candles, straight into hell!
Liquidated! No BNB left!
This feels like a rugpull, it feels like a theft!

[Outro | Chaos | Feedback]
Red candle!
Red candle!
Margin call!
Goodbye!
(Sound of a dial-up modem disconnecting)
```

## Evaluation (Pre-Generation)
*   **Lyrics Score:** 8/10. Captures the specific meme language (Bogdanoff, "He bought? Dump it", Wojak, 100x leverage).
*   **Style Score:** 8/10. The "skate punk" and "shouty/anxious" vocals fit the frantic theme perfectly.
*   **Prediction:** This should result in a high-energy, humorous track that resonates with the "degen" crypto culture.
