**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Church Organ | Soprano Solo]
(Latin Chant: "Lacrimosa... dies illa...")
(Yeah... it's judgment day.)

[Verse 1 | Drill Flow starts over Organ]
They pray for forgiveness, I pray for the win,
Born in the sinner's circle, drowning in sin.
The organ is playing, the choir is singing,
But out on the block, it's the alarm bells ringing.

[Build Up | Timpani Rolls | Choir Swell]
Can you hear the angels cry?
Or is that just the sirens passing by?

[Drop | Massive 808s | Full Orchestra Stabs]
(Sanctus!)
Move with the ghost, phantom of the manor.
(Dominus!)
Strike with the force of a hammer.

[Verse 2 | Fast Flow over Strings]
Violins screeching like tires on the road,
Carrying the weight, yeah, heavy is the load.
Soprano high notes hitting the ceiling,
While we deal with the pain that we're concealing.

[Bridge | Opera Solo vs Whispered Drill]
(Solo Voice: "Pie Jesu...")
Watch your back...
(Solo Voice: "Domine...")
Don't slip...

[Chorus | Epic Finale | Wall of Sound]
Symphony of the streets, tragedy of the beats!
Conducting the chaos from the nosebleed seats!

[Outro | Organ Fade]
Amen.
```
