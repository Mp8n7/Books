[Intro | Horror Strings | Evil Laugh]
(Hahaha!)
You know what time it is!
Slide!

[Verse 1 | Rapid Fire]
Left, right, center, move!
Got nothing to lose, got something to prove!
Bassline shaking the floorboards,
Cutting through the silence like broadswords.
Don't talk, just act,
That's a matter of fact!

[Pre-Chorus | Build Up]
Energy rising!
No compromising!
The bass is sliding!
Where you hiding?

[Drop | Distorted 808 Slides | Chaos]
SLIDE!
(Bass: Wub-wub-wub-wub)
SLIDE!
Take cover!

[Verse 2]
Rhythm distinct, gone in a blink.
Don't even think, don't even blink.
Engine revving, tyres screeching,
It's the limits we are breaching.
Adrenaline spike, strike like a pike,
Do what we like!

[Chorus]
SLIDE!
Left, right!
SLIDE!
Goodnight!

[Outro]
(Bass fading out with distortion)
Yeah.
Done.
```
