**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Rain on Glass SFX | Bus Engine Hum]
Top deck.
Front seat.
3 AM.

[Verse 1 | Monotone Flow]
Ghost town through the window pane,
Streetlights blurring in the rain.
Night bus crawling, N29,
Everybody drunk or out of time.
Chicken shop closed, shutters down,
Silence sweeping through the town.

[Chorus | Deep Sub Bass | Minimal]
Riding through the night.
No destination in sight.
Just the hum of the engine.
And the streetlamp tension.

[Verse 2]
Man in the back talking to himself,
Stories collecting on the shelf.
Phone dead, no battery left,
Feeling the weight, feeling the heft.
Of the city that never sleeps,
But always creeps.

[Breakdown | Distant Siren]
(Passing by...)
(Fading away...)

[Chorus]
Riding through the night.
Just the hum of the engine.

[Outro]
Next stop...
End of the line.
```
