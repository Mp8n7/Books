**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Chains Rattling | Metallic Thud]
Welcome to the dungeon.
(Clank... Clank...)

[Verse 1]
Cold steel, cold hearts.
This is where the nightmare starts.
Underground, below the street,
Can you feel the devil's heat?
Modern life, ancient pain,
Rusting in the London rain.

[Chorus | Heavy Industrial Beat]
London Dungeon, lock the door.
Don't ask for more.
Chains on the floor.
London Dungeon, darkness falls.
Inside these walls.
Nobody calls.

[Verse 2]
Mechanical movements, robotic routine,
Part of the engine, part of the machine.
Grinding gears, grinding teeth,
Look at what lies beneath.
Shadows dancing on the brick,
Tick... tock... tick...

[Bridge | Eerie Drone]
(Whispered)
There is no key.
You can't get free.

[Drop | Metallic Bass Crash]
TRAPPED.
(Industrial noise solo)

[Outro]
The dungeon keeps its secrets.
(Echoing laugh)
```
