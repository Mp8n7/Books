**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Dark Piano | Rain SFX]
(Yeah...)
(Look...)
Estate is quiet tonight.
But the eyes are open.

[Verse 1 | Aggressive Flow]
Concrete walls, grey skies,
Watching the feds circle like flies.
Hood up, head down, moving in silence,
Raised in the noise, born in the violence.
They talk about roads, we walk on the pavement,
Trapped in the system, modern enslavement.

[Chorus | Heavy Bass Drop | Sliding 808s]
(Slide!)
In the concrete estate, no escape.
Every corner, red tape.
Move smart, don't slip, don't brake.
It's a cold world, make no mistake.

[Verse 2 | Fast Triplet Flow]
Zero-seven, call the line,
Wasting no time, yeah the city is mine.
Shadows creeping, paranoia peaking,
It's the truth that we're speaking, the havoc we're wreaking.
(Shh...)
Did you hear that?

[Bridge | Stripped Back]
Sirens fading...
Blue lights trading...

[Chorus | Maximum Energy]
In the concrete estate, no escape!
Move smart, don't slip, don't brake!

[Outro]
Just another night.
Concrete.
(Fade out)
