[Intro | Wind Chimes | Gayageum Pluck]
(Soft strumming)
Hanok.
Old house.
New breeze.

[Verse 1]
Curved tile roof (Giwa) touching the sky,
Clouds are slowly floating by.
Wooden pillar standing strong,
Where the ancestors belong.
Paper window (Changhoji) filtering the light,
Keeping out the cold of night.
Tea ceremony, pouring slow,
Watching the seasons ebb and flow.

[Chorus | Relaxed Beat]
Hanok vibe, ancient and deep.
Secrets that the old walls keep.
Slow down time, rest your head.
On the heated floor (Ondol) bed.
Peace...

[Verse 2]
Walking in the alley, stone wall grey,
History lives in the modern day.
Sparrow sitting on the eaves,
Singing to the falling leaves.
Maru (Wooden floor) cool in the summer heat,
Resting my weary travel feet.
Silence speaks a thousand words,
Better than any I have heard.

[Bridge | Flute Solo]
(Daegeum bamboo flute melody)
Flowing like water.
Standing like wood.

[Chorus]
Hanok vibe, ancient and deep.
Secrets that the old walls keep.

[Outro]
Tranquility.
Tradition.
Home.
(Wind chime fade)
