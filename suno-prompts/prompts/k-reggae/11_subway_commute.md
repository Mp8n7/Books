[Intro | Subway Chime (Tta-reung!) | Sliding Doors]
(Mechanical voice: The train is approaching.)
Step back.
Mind the gap.

[Verse 1]
Line number 2, the green circle line,
Running on the track, running out of time.
Shoulder to shoulder, face to face,
Trapped inside this metal case.
Smartphones glowing in the dark,
No room to move, no room to park.

[Chorus | Heavy Stepper Beat]
Jiha-cheol dub, underground sound.
Round and round, beneath the ground.
Push and shove, survive the ride.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
(Sindorim station... Transfer...)

[Verse 2]
Ahjumma elbows sharp like a knife,
Fighting for a seat, fighting for life.
Air conditioner blowing cold air,
Blank expressions, nobody care.
Tunnel lights flashing, black and white,
Morning rush hour feels like the night.

[Bridge | Announcement Sample]
(Distorted: Please exit on the left.)
(Echo: Left... left... left...)
Next stop.
Gangnam.

[Chorus]
Jiha-cheol dub, underground sound.
Push and shove, survive the ride.

[Outro]
The doors are closing.
Beep. Beep. Beep.
(Fade into tunnel noise)
```
