[Intro | Wedding Bells | Upbeat Drum Fill]
(Ding-dong!)
Today is the day!
Gyeol-hon-shik (Wedding ceremony)!
Congratulations!

[Verse 1 (Male)]
Standing here in the tuxedo black,
There is no turning back.
Waiting for you to walk down the aisle,
Can't help but wear a smile.
(Female)
White dress flowing like a cloud,
Waving to the happy crowd.
Appa (Dad) holding my hand tight,
Everything feels so right.

[Chorus | Duet Harmony]
Wedding day, love is here to stay.
Throw the bouquet, hip-hip-hooray!
Bow to the parents, bow to the guest.
Feeling truly blessed.
Sarang-hae (I love you) forever more!

[Verse 2]
Exchange the rings, make the vow,
We are a family now.
Pyebaek ceremony, catch the date,
Sealing our destiny and fate.
Honeymoon to a tropical isle,
Living in happiness for a while.
Buffet waiting, let's go eat,
Dancing on our happy feet.

[Bridge | Brass Fanfare]
chuk-ha-hae (Congratulations)!
Kiss the bride!
Clap your hands!

[Chorus]
Wedding day, love is here to stay.
Throw the bouquet, hip-hip-hooray!

[Outro]
Just married.
Happy life.
Let's go!
