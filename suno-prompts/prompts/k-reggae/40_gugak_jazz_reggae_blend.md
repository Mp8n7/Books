**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Double Bass | Haegeum]
(Walking bassline mixed with fiddle)
East meets West.
Jazz meets Tradition.
One rhythm.

[Verse 1]
Walking on the rhythm of the Janggu drum,
Waiting for the melody to come.
Blue note saxophone crying low,
Han (Sorrow) is starting to flow.
Scat singing in a traditional scale,
Telling an ancient, jazzy tale.
Improvisation on a reggae beat,
Making the fusion sound complete.

[Chorus | Complex Harmony]
Gugak Jazz, soul of the land.
Played by a master hand.
Reggae heart beating inside.
Taking us on a musical ride.
Eol-ssu! (Scat: Doo-wop-ba-doo!)

[Verse 2]
Piano keys dancing like falling rain,
Washing away the history of pain.
Haegeum weeping a sorrowful song,
Where does the spirit truly belong?
Syncopation in the morning light,
Swing rhythm in the dead of night.
Three rivers flowing into one sea,
This is the sound of being free.

[Bridge | Saxophone & Haegeum Duel]
(Call and response improvisation)
(Jazz lick meets Pentatonic scale)
Higher!
Deeper!

[Chorus]
Gugak Jazz, soul of the land.
Played by a master hand.

[Outro]
(Free jazz chaos fading into reggae skank)
One soul.
Art.
(Final chord)
```
