[Intro | Motorcycle Revving | App Notification]
(App sound: Baedal Minjok!)
Order received!
Helmet on! Let's go!
Vroom!

[Verse 1]
Weaving through the traffic, running the red,
Gotta get the chicken there before it's dead (cold).
Fried chicken, pizza, jjajangmyeon too,
Coming straight from the kitchen to you.
Phone on the handle, map on the screen,
Fastest rider that you ever seen.

[Chorus | Heavy Digital Beat]
Baedal rider, king of the street!
Bringing the fire, bringing the heat!
Ding-dong! Bell ring! Food is at the door!
Then I'm back on the bike to get some more!
Ppal-li! (Faster!) Ppal-li! (Faster!)

[Verse 2]
Rain or snow, I don't care,
I'm flying through the Seoul city air.
Delivery fee rising, time is money,
This dangerous life ain't always funny.
Apartment complex, elevator slow,
Check the address, 10th floor, let's go!

[Bridge | Engine Idling]
No contact delivery.
Leave it at the door.
Photo snap. Done.
Next order!

[Chorus]
Baedal rider, king of the street!
Bringing the fire, bringing the heat!

[Outro]
Review 5 stars please!
Be safe.
