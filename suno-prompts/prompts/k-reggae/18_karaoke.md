[Intro | Tambourine | Microphone Feedback]
(Microphone check: Ah! Ah! Mic test!)
Noraebang time!
Number 18, let's go!
Service time added!

[Verse 1]
Grab the mic, don't let it go,
Tonight I am the star of the show.
Tambourine shaking in my left hand,
Leader of the karaoke band.
Ballad, hip-hop, trot or rock,
Singing 'til 4 o'clock.

[Chorus | Upbeat Ska Rhythm]
Noraebang star, shining bright!
Screaming out with all our might!
Echo max, reverb high!
Singing songs until we die!
Service! (More time!) Service! (More time!)

[Verse 2]
Score is 100, perfect pitch,
Life is good, life is rich.
Book pages turning fast,
Reliving memories of the past.
Voice is cracking but feeling free,
This room is paradise to me.

[Bridge | Cheesy Synth Solo]
(Synth melody)
(Group shouting: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Ten minutes left!
Last song!

[Chorus]
Noraebang star, shining bright!
Screaming out with all our might!

[Outro]
(Applause sound effect)
Thank you Seoul!
Time's up.
(Machine shutdown sound)
