[Intro | Gentle Saxophone | Birdsong]
Springtime is here.
Petals in the wind.
Beot-kkot ending... or beginning?

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street in Yeouido,
Where the pink flowers start to grow.
Holding your hand, feeling the breeze,
Falling petals from the cherry trees.
Winter is gone, the ice has melted away,
Walking with you on this perfect day.

[Chorus | Sweet Harmony]
Cherry blossom falling down,
Painting pink all over town.
Beot-kkot love, so sweet and true.
Bloom again when I look at you.
(Whoa-oh-oh... Spring love)

[Verse 2]
Busker singing a love song nearby,
Cotton candy clouds in the sky.
Take a photo to freeze this time,
When the weather and you are prime.
Don't let the wind blow it all apart,
Keep this blossom inside your heart.

[Bridge | Guitar Solo]
(Clean, melodic lovers rock solo)
Falling... falling...
Like snow in April.

[Chorus]
Cherry blossom falling down,
Painting pink all over town.
Beot-kkot love, so sweet and true.

[Outro]
Before the rain comes.
Let's stay here.
Just us.
```
