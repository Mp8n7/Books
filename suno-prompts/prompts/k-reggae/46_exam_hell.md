[Intro | Heartbeat | Clock Ticking]
D-Day.
Suneung (CSAT).
Twelve years for this one day.

[Verse 1]
Waking up in darkness, cold morning air,
Mother is praying with a silent care.
Police escort motorbike, siren wail,
Must not fail, must not fail.
School gate closing, silence in the hall,
Writing the answer, standing tall.
Future is waiting on a paper sheet,
Trembling hands and trembling feet.

[Chorus | Heavy Bass Pulse]
Exam hell, burning in the brain.
Pressure falling like the heavy rain.
One chance, one shot, make it count.
Climbing up the knowledge mount.
Suneung... (Echo: Neung... neung...)

[Verse 2]
English listening, silence in the sky,
Even the airplanes do not fly.
Lunchbox tasting like dust and fear,
The end is near, the end is near.
Sunset falling, last exam is done,
Did I lose or did I won?
Walking out the gate, emptiness inside,
Nothing left to hide.

[Bridge | Sigh Sound]
It's over.
Freedom?
Or emptiness?

[Chorus]
Exam hell, burning in the brain.
Pressure falling like the heavy rain.

[Outro]
Good job (Su-go-haet-seo).
Sleep now.
(Clock stops)
