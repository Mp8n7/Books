[Intro | Accordion | "Ppong-jjak" Rhythm]
A-ssa!
Ppong-jjak Reggae!
Let's go! (Gaja!)

[Verse 1 | Trot Vocal Style]
My life is a winding road, twisting here and there,
Sometimes heavy burdens are too much to bear.
But when the rhythm hits me, I feel young again,
Dancing in the sunshine, dancing in the rain.
A-igo! My aching back! But I don't care today!

[Chorus | Bouncy Beat]
Jjagan-jjagan-jjagan! (Guitar skank!)
Trot meets Reggae, what a plan!
Shake your shoulders, clap your hands!
Best music in the land!
Ppong-jjak-ppong-jjak! Yah!

[Verse 2]
Soju is sweet today, sorrow flies away,
Listen to the music the accordion play.
From Busan to Seoul, everyone knows the beat,
Moving your body and tapping your feet.
Brother, sister, auntie too,
This melody is meant for you!

[Bridge | Brass Solo]
(Trot melody played on Reggae brass section)
(Dramatic vibrato vocal ad-lib)
Ooooooh-woah!

[Chorus]
Jjagan-jjagan-jjagan!
Trot meets Reggae, what a plan!
Shake your shoulders, clap your hands!

[Outro]
One more time!
Ppong-jjak!
Thank you!
(Bow)
