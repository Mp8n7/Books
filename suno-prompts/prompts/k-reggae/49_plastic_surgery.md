[Intro | Medical Monitor Beep | Scalpel]
Doctor.
Make me beautiful.
Gangnam style.

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street with a bandage face,
Transformation in this expensive place.
Apgujeong clinic, marble floor,
Opening a brand new destiny door.
Swollen eyes hidden behind the shade,
Price of beauty must be paid.
New nose, new chin, new life to start,
But still the same old lonely heart.

[Chorus | Synthetic Beat]
Gangnam Unnie, plastic queen.
Living in a surgery dream.
Cut and paste, stitch and sew.
Where did the real face go?
Yeppeo? (Pretty?) Yeppeo? (Pretty?)

[Verse 2]
Consultation room, 3D scan,
Part of the beauty master plan.
Anesthesia sleep, waking up in pain,
Beauty requires a little strain.
Before and after photos on the wall,
Answering the society call.
Clone army walking in a row,
Identical faces start to show.

[Bridge | Heart Monitor]
(Beep... beep... beep...)
Pulse is stable.
Operation success.
Unwrap.

[Chorus]
Gangnam Unnie, plastic queen.
Living in a surgery dream.

[Outro]
Who am I?
Does it matter?
I am beautiful.
```
