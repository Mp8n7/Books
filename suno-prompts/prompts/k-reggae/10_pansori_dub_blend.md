**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Buk Drum | Dub Siren]
(Siren echo: Woooo...)
(Pansori wail: Aigo... Aigo...)
Listen to the story.

[Verse 1 | Pansori Style Delivery]
Over the mountains, across the sea,
A sorrowful spirit comes to me.
Han flowing deep like a river of tears,
Carrying the weight of a thousand years.
(Dub delay on vocal: Years... years... years...)

[Chorus | Massive Sub Bass Drop]
Pansori Dub, ancient soul.
Deep in the bass, losing control.
Cry of the past, echo of today.
Music takes the pain away.
Eol-ssu! (Right on!) Jota! (Good!)

[Verse 2]
Gayageum plucking a sad melody,
Mixing with the dub philosophy.
The storyteller strikes the drum,
Waiting for the kingdom to come.
Voice like thunder, heart like stone,
Walking this rhythm all alone.

[Bridge | Gayageum x Space Echo]
(Traditional zither solo with heavy delay effects)
(Mystical atmosphere)
Spirits rising.

[Chorus]
Pansori Dub, ancient soul.
Cry of the past, echo of today.
Eol-ssu!

[Outro]
(Long sustained vocal note fading into delay)
The story ends.
But the echo remains.
(Fade to black)
```
