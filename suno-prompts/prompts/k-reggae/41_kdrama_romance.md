**Lyrics:**

[Intro | Orchestral Strings | Piano]
(Softly)
Sarang-hae...
You are my destiny.

[Verse 1]
Walking in the rain without an umbrella,
Waiting for my Cinderella.
Car stops, window rolls down slow,
Chaebol heir with a gentle glow.
Time stops, slow motion scene,
You are the king, I am the queen.
Destiny pulling us close together,
Promising love in stormy weather.

[Chorus | Dramatic Swell]
K-Drama love, written in the stars.
Healing all the hidden scars.
Back hug in the falling snow.
Never ever let you go.
(My love... My destiny...)

[Verse 2]
Amnesia took your memory away,
But my heart remembers every day.
Evil mother trying to break us apart,
Throwing water on my burning heart.
Subway station, missed you by a chance,
Tragic fate in this romance.
But the red string ties us tight,
We will win this love fight.

[Bridge | Electric Guitar Solo]
(Emotional, crying guitar)
Don't cry.
I will protect you.
Always.

[Chorus]
K-Drama love, written in the stars.
Healing all the hidden scars.

[Outro]
Freeze frame.
To be continued.
OST ending.
```
