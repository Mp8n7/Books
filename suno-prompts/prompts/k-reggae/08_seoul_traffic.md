[Intro | Car Horns | Traffic Noise]
Bwah! Bwah!
Move out the way!
Seoul city gridlock!
Every single day!

[Verse 1]
Gangnam-daero, stuck in the jam,
Don't give a damn, who I am.
Red light, red light, never turn green,
Worst traffic jam that you ever seen.
Taxi driver shouting on the phone,
Just wanna go, wanna go home.
Bus driver cutting in the lane,
Driving me crazy, driving insane!

[Chorus | Heavy Ragga Beat]
Traffic jam, Seoul city slam!
Bumper to bumper, damn damn damn!
Olympic highway, parking lot!
Engine overheating, getting hot!
Move! (Move!) Move! (Move!)

[Verse 2]
Subway is faster but I took the car,
Now I ain't going very far.
Motorcycles weaving through the gap,
Caught in the rush hour trap.
Boss is calling, "Where are you?"
Stuck on the bridge with a river view.
Stress level rising, blood pressure high,
Watching the minutes ticking by!

[Bridge | Siren FX]
Wee-ooo-wee-ooo!
Ambulance coming through!
Make a hole!

[Chorus]
Traffic jam, Seoul city slam!
Bumper to bumper, damn damn damn!

[Outro]
Finally moving.
Wait... red light again?
Aish!
