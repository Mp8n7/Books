[Intro | Store Door Chime Sound | Lo-Fi Crackle]
(Ding-dong)
새벽 2시 (2 AM).
Neon lights buzzing.

[Verse 1]
파란 플라스틱 의자 (Blue plastic chairs) on the patio outside,
술 취한 사람들 (Drunk people) trying to hide.
삼각김밥 (Triangle kimbap) and a banana milk,
City night feeling smooth like silk.
알바생은 꾸벅꾸벅 (Part-timer nodding off) head on the desk,
This quiet moment is simply the best.

[Chorus | Deep Bass | Soft Vocals]
편의점 불빛 (Pyeonejeom lights), shining so bright.
A beacon of hope in the middle of the night.
Two plus one (2+1), yeah that's the deal.
전자레인지 빙글빙글 (Microwave spinning), keeping it real.

[Verse 2]
초록색 병 소리 (Green bottle sound) clinking in the crate,
왜 안 자고 있을까 (Why am I awake) up so late.
얼음컵에 커피 (Coffee in ice cup), paying the price,
City life vice, cold as ice.
외로운 영혼들 (Lonely souls) meet under the fluorescent glow,
Where we go next, nobody knows.

[Bridge | Rhodes Piano Solo]
(Dreamy texture)
냉장고 소리 (Fridge humming)...
도시의 소음 (City noise)...

[Chorus]
편의점 불빛 (Pyeonejeom lights), shining so bright.
A beacon of hope in the middle of the night.

[Outro]
(Ding-dong)
내일 봐요 (See you tomorrow).
```
