[Intro | Store Door Chime Sound | Lo-Fi Crackle]
(Ding-dong)
2 AM.
Neon lights buzzing.

[Verse 1]
Blue plastic chairs on the patio outside,
Watching the drunk people trying to hide.
Triangle kimbap and a banana milk,
City night feeling smooth like silk.
The clerk is sleeping with his head on the desk,
This quiet moment is simply the best.

[Chorus | Deep Bass | Soft Vocals]
Pyeonejeom lights, shining so bright.
A beacon of hope in the middle of the night.
Buy 2 Get 1 Free, yeah that's the deal.
Microwave spinning, keeping it real.

[Verse 2]
Soju bottles clinking in the green crate,
Wondering why I am staying up so late.
Instant coffee in a cup of ice,
Paying the price for the city life vice.
Lonely souls meet under the fluorescent glow,
Where we go next, nobody knows.

[Bridge | Rhodes Piano Solo]
(Dreamy texture)
Humming of the fridge...
Humming of the city...

[Chorus]
Pyeonejeom lights, shining so bright.
A beacon of hope in the middle of the night.

[Outro]
(Ding-dong)
See you tomorrow.
