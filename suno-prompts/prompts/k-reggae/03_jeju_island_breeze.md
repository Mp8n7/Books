[Intro | Ocean Waves | Ukulele Strum]
Jeju Island!
Blue ocean, blue sky!
Let's fly!

[Verse 1 (Male)]
Leaving the grey city behind,
Got a plane ticket and peace of mind.
Hallasan mountain touching the clouds,
Far away from the Seoul city crowds.
Tangerine trees smelling so sweet,
Sand underneath my bare feet.

[Chorus (Duet)]
Jeju breeze, blowing through the trees.
Dol Hareubang watching over me.
Emerald water, black volcanic stone.
This island feeling is inside my bone.
Jeju-do! (Hey!) Jeju-do! (Ho!)

[Verse 2 (Female)]
Driving the coast road, wind in my hair,
Abalone porridge, nothing compare.
Udo Island boat ride today,
Wash all the stress and the worry away.
Sunrise peak, waiting for the dawn,
Yesterday's troubles are dead and gone.

[Bridge | Steel Drum Solo]
(Tropical melody)
Dancing on the beach...
Hyeopjae beach...

[Chorus]
Jeju breeze, blowing through the trees!
Dol Hareubang watching over me!

[Outro]
See you next summer.
Jeju love.
```
