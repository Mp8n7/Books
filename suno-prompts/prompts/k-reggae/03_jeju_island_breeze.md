[Intro | Ocean Waves | Ukulele Strum]
제주도 푸른 밤 (Jeju Island blue night)!
Blue ocean, blue sky!
떠나요 (Let's leave)!

[Verse 1 (Male)]
회색 도시를 떠나 (Leaving the grey city),
Got a plane ticket and peace of mind.
한라산 구름 위로 (Hallasan above clouds),
Far away from the Seoul city crowds.
귤 향기 가득해 (Full of tangerine scent), so sweet,
모래사장 위 (On the sand) bare feet.

[Chorus (Duet)]
Jeju breeze, blowing through the trees.
돌하르방 (Dol Hareubang) watching over me.
에메랄드 빛 바다 (Emerald sea), black volcanic stone.
This island feeling is inside my bone.
제주도! (Hey!) 제주도! (Ho!)

[Verse 2 (Female)]
해안도로 드라이브 (Coastal road drive), wind in my hair,
전복죽 (Abalone porridge), nothing compare.
우도 배를 타고 (Riding Udo boat) today,
Wash all the stress and the worry away.
성산일출봉 (Sunrise Peak), waiting for the dawn,
Yesterday's troubles are dead and gone.

[Bridge | Steel Drum Solo]
(Tropical melody)
협재 해변에서 (At Hyeopjae Beach)...
춤을 춰요 (Let's dance)...

[Chorus]
Jeju breeze, blowing through the trees!
돌하르방 watching over me!

[Outro]
내년에 또 봐요 (See you next year).
Jeju love.
```
