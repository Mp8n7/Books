[Intro | Wind Howling | Silence]
Gangwon-do mountains.
Heavy snow (Pok-seol).
Silence.

[Verse 1]
White blanket covering the world tonight,
Everything reflecting the pale moonlight.
Roads are closed, we are trapped inside,
Nowhere to go, nowhere to ride.
Breath is turning into clouds of steam,
Living inside a frozen dream.
Pine trees bowing under the weight,
Accepting their icy winter fate.

[Chorus | Massive Sub Bass]
Winter dub, cold and deep.
The mountain is asleep.
Snow is falling, thick and slow.
Gangwon-do... (Echo: Do... do... do...)
Frozen time.

[Verse 2]
Boiling potatoes on the old wood stove,
Warmth is the treasure in this frozen cove.
Window frosted with an icy lace,
Disappearing without a trace.
Sound is muffled, world is still,
Standing on the winter hill.
Isolated but feeling fine,
In this white world of mine.

[Bridge | Crystal Synth]
(Icy texture)
Zero degrees.
Minus ten.
Freeze.

[Chorus]
Winter dub, cold and deep.
The mountain is asleep.

[Outro]
Spring will come.
But not today.
(Wind fading)
