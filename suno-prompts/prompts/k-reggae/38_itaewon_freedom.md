[Intro | Party Whistle | Brass]
Itaewon!
Freedom!
Everybody come together!

[Verse 1]
Walking up the hill, many faces meet,
Different languages on the street.
Kebab, Pizza, Kimchi stew,
Everything waiting here for you.
From the station to the Hamilton Hotel,
Under the magic Itaewon spell.
No judgment here, just be who you are,
Shining bright like a shooting star.

[Chorus | Upbeat Ska]
Itaewon Freedom! Place to be!
World village for you and me.
Music pumping from every door.
Dancing on the international floor.
Freedom! (Yeah!) Freedom! (Yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Rooftop bar with a city view,
Meeting old friends and making new.
Halloween party or Christmas Eve,
This is a place you never want to leave.
Diverse colors painting the town,
Turning the frown upside down.
Global rhythm, universal beat,
Dancing on the Itaewon street.

[Bridge | Brass Solo]
(Happy trumpet and trombone)
One world!
One love!
Let's dance!

[Chorus]
Itaewon Freedom! Place to be!
World village for you and me.

[Outro]
See you next weekend.
Peace.
Love.
(Party noise fading)
