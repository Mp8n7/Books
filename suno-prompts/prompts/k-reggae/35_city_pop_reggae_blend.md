[Intro | Synthesizer | Slap Bass]
Seoul City...
1988 vibe.
Midnight driving.

[Verse 1]
Neon lights reflecting on the Han River stream,
Living inside a plastic love dream.
Driving the convertible, wind in my hair,
City lights glowing without a care.
Cassette tape playing a melody sweet,
Rhythm of the city beneath my feet.
Telephone booth ringing in the rain,
Calling you up to ease the pain.

[Chorus | Sophisticated Harmony]
City Pop Reggae, swaying in the night.
Everything is glowing neon bright.
Retro feeling, modern touch.
I miss you so very much.
(Saxophone fill)

[Verse 2]
High-rise window, glass of wine,
Waiting for the perfect sign.
Jazz bar music drifting through the air,
Sophisticated love affair.
Time is frozen in a photograph,
Echo of your distant laugh.
Seoul night is lonely but it is chic,
Playing hide and seek.

[Bridge | Saxophone Solo]
(80s style smooth jazz sax)
Smooth...
Groovy...

[Chorus]
City Pop Reggae, swaying in the night.
Everything is glowing neon bright.

[Outro]
Fade away.
Into the night.
City lights.
```
