[Intro | Bubble Organ | Guitar Skank]
(Yeah...)
Hangang vibe.
Seoul city sunset.
Let it flow.

[Verse 1]
Sitting by the river, water flowing slow,
Delivery scooter coming, yeah we waiting for the dough.
Chimaek on the grass, wind in my hair,
Worries floating away, floating in the air.
Mapo Bridge lights starting to glow,
Forget the hustle, take it slow.

[Chorus | Brass Section | Harmony]
Han River chilling, feeling so right.
Seoul city shining, deep in the night.
No stress, no pressure, just you and me.
Under the bridge, wild and free.
(Jah Rastafari in Seoul city!)

[Verse 2]
Instant ramyeon cooking on the foil,
We leave behind the day's hard toil.
Bicycles passing, ding-ding-ding,
Listen to the melody that the river sing.
Gangnam skyscrapers far away,
This is where I want to stay.

[Bridge | Saxophone Solo]
(Smooth jazz-reggae fusion)
Yeah...
Feel the breeze.

[Chorus]
Han River chilling, feeling so right!
Seoul city shining, deep in the night!

[Outro]
One love.
One Seoul.
(Fade out with river sounds)
