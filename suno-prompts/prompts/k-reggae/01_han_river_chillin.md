[Intro | Bubble Organ | Guitar Skank]
(Yeah...)
Hangang vibe.
Seoul city sunset.
Let it flow.

[Verse 1]
강가에 앉아 (Sitting by the river), water flowing slow,
배달 오토바이 소리 (Delivery scooter sound), yeah we waiting for the dough.
잔디 위엔 치맥 (Chimaek on the grass), wind in my hair,
걱정은 날려보내 (Worries floating away), floating in the air.
마포대교 불빛 (Mapo Bridge lights) starting to glow,
Forget the hustle, take it slow.

[Chorus | Brass Section | Harmony]
Han River chilling, feeling so right.
Seoul city shining, deep in the night.
No stress, no pressure, just you and me.
다리 밑에서 (Under the bridge), wild and free.
(Jah Rastafari in Seoul city!)

[Verse 2]
은박지 라면 (Foil ramyeon) cooking on the boil,
We leave behind the day's hard toil.
자전거 지나가네 (Bicycles passing), ding-ding-ding,
Listen to the melody that the river sing.
강남 빌딩들 (Gangnam skyscrapers) far away,
이곳이 좋아 (I like this place), I want to stay.

[Bridge | Saxophone Solo]
(Smooth jazz-reggae fusion)
Yeah...
바람을 느껴봐 (Feel the breeze).

[Chorus]
Han River chilling, feeling so right!
Seoul city shining, deep in the night!

[Outro]
One love.
One Seoul.
(Fade out with river sounds)
