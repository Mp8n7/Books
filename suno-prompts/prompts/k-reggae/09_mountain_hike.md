[Intro | Birdsong | Flute]
Breathing in the mountain air.
Step by step.
Higher we go.

[Verse 1]
Early morning, laces tied tight,
Sun is shining so pure and bright.
Colorful jackets, neon and red,
Climbing the path that lies ahead.
Ajumma passing, sharing a smile,
We have been walking for a mile.
Rocks and roots on the forest floor,
Nature is opening her door.

[Chorus | Upbeat Strum]
Deung-san! Climb the mountain high!
Reach your hands up to the sky.
Sweat is falling but spirit is strong.
This is where we all belong.
Bukhansan! Seoraksan! Jirisan!

[Verse 2]
Reaching the peak, look at the view,
Sky is painting a perfect blue.
Sit on the rock, open the pack,
Makgeolli rice wine and a snack.
Cucumber stick and a hard boiled egg,
Resting the muscle in the leg.
Cheers to the health and the life we live,
Taking the joy that the mountains give.

[Bridge | Percussion Break]
(Bongo solo)
Heart beating...
Wind blowing...

[Chorus]
Deung-san! Climb the mountain high!
Sweat is falling but spirit is strong.

[Outro]
Walking down is easy.
Be careful.
Namaste.
```
