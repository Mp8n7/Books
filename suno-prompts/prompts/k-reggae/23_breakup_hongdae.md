[Intro | Street Ambience | Distant Guitar]
Hongdae playground.
Too many people.
But I am alone.

[Verse 1]
You said goodbye in front of the station,
Ending our long conversation.
Neon signs blurring in my teary eye,
Why did we have to say goodbye?
Young couples walking hand in hand,
Walking through this busy land.
Busker singing a happy song,
Everything feels so wrong.

[Chorus | Soulful Harmony]
Hongdae blues, crying in the street.
Walking with lead in my feet.
Sarang (Love) is gone, left me behind.
Peace of mind is hard to find.
Gaji-ma (Don't go)...

[Verse 2]
Should I go drink till the pain is gone?
Wait for the breaking of the dawn.
Your perfume lingers on my coat,
Lump is rising in my throat.
Deleted your number, blocked your face,
Leaving this memory-filled place.
The cold wind blows through the alleyway,
Ending of a tragic day.

[Bridge | Piano Solo]
(Sad, bluesy melody)
He-eo-jim (Breakup).
It hurts so much.

[Chorus]
Hongdae blues, crying in the street.
Sarang is gone, left me behind.

[Outro]
Goodbye my love.
Jal-ga (Go well).
(Fade into city noise)
```
