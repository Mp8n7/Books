[Intro | Clock Ticking | Printer Noise]
Tick-tock.
Tick-tock.
Is it time yet?
No.

[Verse 1]
Office lights humming overhead,
Wishing I was home in my bed.
Boss is watching from the glass door,
Giving me work, more and more.
Eyes are burning, coffee is cold,
Doing exactly what I am told.
Window shows the city night view,
Everyone sleeping except for few.

[Chorus | Heavy Bass Drop]
Yageun dub, working till the dawn.
Brain is dead, energy is gone.
Overtime, overtime, every single day.
Watching my young life fade away.
(Echo: Work... work... work...)

[Verse 2]
Report due by 9 AM,
Typing on the keyboard again and again.
Convenience store dinner, microwave meal,
Is this life really real?
Taxi waiting on the empty street,
Dragging my heavy, tired feet.
Salary hits the bank account,
But is it worth the amount?

[Bridge | Dark Synth]
(Distorted voice)
Approved?
Rejected.
Do it again.

[Chorus]
Yageun dub, working till the dawn.
Brain is dead, energy is gone.

[Outro]
Power off.
Go home.
Sleep.
(Clock stops)
```
