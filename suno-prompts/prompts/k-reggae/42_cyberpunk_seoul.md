[Intro | Synth Arpeggio | Drone Flyby]
Neo-Seoul.
2077.
System online.

[Verse 1]
Hologram dragon flying over the street,
Cybernetic implant keeping the beat.
Gangnam skyscrapers touching the moon,
Flying taxi arriving soon.
Neon rain falling on the metal skin,
Digital world is where we begin.
Data stream flowing in the cable line,
Future city looking so fine.

[Chorus | Digital Bass]
Cyberpunk Seoul, neon light.
Shining in the eternal night.
Human heart, machine mind.
Leaving the past behind.
Connect. (Upload.) Connect. (Download.)

[Verse 2]
VR headset, virtual date,
Programming destiny, coding fate.
Robot waiter serving the tea,
Is this reality or fantasy?
Han River glowing electric blue,
Artificial intelligence watching you.
High tech life, high speed lane,
Digital pleasure, digital pain.

[Bridge | Vocoder Solo]
(Robotic voice)
System error.
Rebooting.
Are you real?

[Chorus]
Cyberpunk Seoul, neon light.
Shining in the eternal night.

[Outro]
Power down.
Sleep mode.
Goodbye.
(Glitch sound)
