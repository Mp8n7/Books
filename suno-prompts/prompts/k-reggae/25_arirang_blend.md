[Intro | Haegeum Fiddle | Reggae Organ Shuffle]
(The melody of Arirang played on organ)
Arirang...
Reggae style.

[Verse 1]
Crossing the mountain pass today,
My love has gone far away.
Ten miles walking, feet are sore,
Can't take this pain anymore.
But the rhythm keeps me moving on,
Until the dark night is gone.

[Chorus | Choir Anthem]
Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo.
Crossing over the Arirang Pass.
If you leave me and go away,
Your feet will hurt before the day.
(Reggae beat: Chak-chak-chak!)

[Verse 2]
Stars are shining in the northern sky,
Too many dreams passing by.
Wind is blowing from the East Sea,
Bringing the spirit to you and me.
Sadness turns into a song of hope,
Helping us all to cope.

[Bridge | Brass & Haegeum Call and Response]
(Traditional melody meets Jamaican brass)
Unity.
Peace.
Han (Sorrow) into Joy (Heung).

[Chorus]
Arirang, Arirang, Arariyo.
Crossing over the Arirang Pass.

[Outro]
Arirang...
Korea...
One love.
(Fade out)
```
