[Intro | Crunch Sound | Beer Can Opening]
(Psssh!)
Chimaek time!
Are you hungry?
Let's eat!

[Verse 1]
Golden skin, crispy and hot,
Best flavor in the entire spot.
Yangnyeom (Spicy sauce) dripping sticky red,
Forget the diet, eat this instead.
Radish cubes (Mu) white and sour,
Happy hour, chicken hour!
Drumstick, wing, breast or thigh,
Flavor taking me to the sky.

[Chorus | Upbeat Rhythm]
Chimaek love, chicken and beer!
Best combination of the year!
Crispy crunch, sip the foam.
Eating paradise in my home.
Mashis-seo! (Delicious!) Jjang! (The best!)

[Verse 2]
Half and half (Ban-ban), get the best of both,
To love the chicken is a solemn oath.
Cool lagar washing it down,
Best delivery in the town.
Garlic soy sauce, salty and sweet,
Rhythm moving my hungry feet.
One box, two box, maybe three?
Chicken party for you and me.

[Bridge | Crunching Rhythm]
(Rhythmic crunching: Crunch! Crunch!)
So crispy.
So tasty.
Don't touch my drumstick!

[Chorus]
Chimaek love, chicken and beer!
Best combination of the year!

[Outro]
Burp.
Excuse me.
Full satisfying.
Goodnight.
