[Intro | Coffee Shop Sounds | Piano]
3 PM.
Gangnam station exit 10.
Dugun dugun (Heart beating).

[Verse 1]
Checking my reflection in the window glass,
Praying that this nervousness will pass.
Friend said he is tall and kind,
But love is hard to find.
He walks in wearing a blue coat,
My heart is jumping in my throat.
"Annyeong haseyo," bow my head,
Face is turning tomato red.

[Chorus | Sweet Melody]
Sogeting vibe, feeling so shy.
Butterflies dancing in the sky.
Coffee is hot but my hands are cold.
Is this a story to be told?
Cheot-in-sang (First impression), so sweet.

[Verse 2]
Awkward silence, sip the tea,
He is looking straight at me.
"What is your hobby? What is your style?"
He answers with a gentle smile.
"MBTI is ENFP,"
Maybe he is the one for me?
Exchange the numbers, KakaoTalk,
Maybe take a little walk?

[Bridge | Saxophone Solo]
(Romantic melody)
Seol-le-im (Fluttering feeling).
Falling...

[Chorus]
Sogeting vibe, feeling so shy.
Butterflies dancing in the sky.

[Outro]
After (After-party)?
Movie?
Joh-a-yo (I like it).
```
