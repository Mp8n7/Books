[Intro | Seagull Cry | Waves]
Busan city!
Listen to the ocean.
O-i-so! Bo-i-so! Sa-i-so! (Come! Look! Buy!)

[Verse 1]
Jagalchi Market, smell of the fish,
Ajumma selling whatever you wish.
Haeundae beach, sand is so white,
Gwangan Bridge shining in the night.
We speak loud and we eat spicy food,
Busan people in a reggae mood.
Life is hard but the spirit is tough,
One bottle of Soju is never enough.

[Chorus | Group Singalong]
Busan Galmaegi (Seagull), fly high!
Busan Galmaegi, touch the sky!
Port city rhythm, salty and free.
Come down to the southern sea.
Ma! (Hey!) Sala-itne! (Alive!)

[Verse 2]
Baseball stadium, screaming the song,
Orange bags on our heads all night long.
Gukbap (Soup rice) steaming in the morning air,
Wash away the hangover and the despair.
From the mountains down to the deep blue,
This city has a hold on you.
Rough on the outside, warm in the heart,
We never drift apart.

[Bridge | Accordion Solo]
(Sailor style melody)
Busan... my home.
Feel the waves.

[Chorus]
Busan Galmaegi, fly high!
Busan Galmaegi, touch the sky!

[Outro]
Busan style.
Don't forget.
(Seagulls fading)
