**Lyrics:**

[Intro | Kkwaenggwari Solo | Ragga Shout]
(Metal gong: Kaeng-kaeng-kaeng!)
Samulnori meets the Ragga beat!
Put your hands up!
Eol-ssu!

[Verse 1 | Fast Chatting]
Four instruments playing the sound of the storm,
Breaking the rules, breaking the norm.
Kkwaenggwari lightning strike from the sky,
Jing is the wind blowing low and high.
Janggu is the rain falling on the ground,
Buk is the clouds, thunder rolling round.
Nature's rhythm, Korean soul,
Ragga bass makes it lose control!

[Chorus | Percussion Explosion]
Samulnori Ragga, beat don't stop!
Harvest festival, climbing to the top!
Strike the drum, hit the gong!
Dancing to the rhythm all night long!
Jota! (Good!) Jota! (Good!)

[Verse 2]
Ribbon hat spinning round my head,
Wake up the living, wake up the dead.
Farmers music in a digital age,
Setting the fire on the center stage.
Fast and faster, acceleration,
Feel the vibration of the nation.
East meets West in a percussion clash,
Sonic boom, rhythmic crash!

[Bridge | Janggu Solo]
(Hourglass drum solo: Dung-dak-kung-dak!)
Faster!
Hwimori rhythm!
Let's go!

[Chorus]
Samulnori Ragga, beat don't stop!
Harvest festival, climbing to the top!

[Outro]
(Gong crash)
Eol-ssu!
Respect.
(Feedback fade)
