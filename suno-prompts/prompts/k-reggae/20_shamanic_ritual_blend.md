**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Bell Shaking | Gong Crash]
(Chanting: Eol-ssu!)
Spirits come down.
Open the gate.

[Verse 1 | Trance Rhythm]
Dancing on the knife edge sharp,
Playing the spiritual harp.
Bells are ringing, calling names,
Walking through the ritual flames.
White robes spinning in a trance,
Join the ancient spirit dance.

[Chorus | Heavy Bass | Gong]
Gut! Break the curse!
Dub rhythm make the spirit disperse!
Ancestors watching from the sky.
Answer the shaman's cry!
(Echo: Cry... cry... cry...)

[Verse 2]
Beat the drum and beat the chest,
Put the restless soul to rest.
Offering fruit and offering wine,
Crossing the forbidden line.
Possession taking hold of me,
Set the bound spirit free.

[Bridge | Frenzied Percussion]
(Kkwaenggwari rhythm intense)
(Shaman speaking in tongues)
Faster! Faster!
Release!

[Chorus]
Gut! Break the curse!
Dub rhythm make the spirit disperse!

[Outro]
(Heavy breathing)
The gate is closed.
Peace.
(Fading bells)
```
