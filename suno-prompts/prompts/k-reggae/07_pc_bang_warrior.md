[Intro | 8-Bit Coin Sound | Boot Up Sequence]
Login complete.
Game start!
PC Bang Reggae!

[Verse 1]
Headset on, world locked out,
Hear the gamers scream and shout.
Click-clack-click mechanical keys,
Fighting zombies, fighting disease.
Ramen cup noodles by my side,
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

[Chorus | Digital Synth Skank]
PC Bang Warrior, living the life.
Virtual gun and a virtual knife.
Level up, level up, grinding all night.
Under the monitor's blue light.
GG! (Good Game!) GG! (Good Game!)

[Verse 2]
Mid-lane push, don't be late,
Determine our digital fate.
Top up time on the machine,
Living inside the LCD screen.
Smoke room break, then back to the chair,
Victory feeling is in the air.

[Bridge | Chiptune Solo]
(Retro Mario-style reggae melody)
Boss battle coming!
Ready?

[Chorus]
PC Bang Warrior, living the life.
Under the monitor's blue light.

[Outro]
Game Over.
Insert Coin.
Log out.
```
