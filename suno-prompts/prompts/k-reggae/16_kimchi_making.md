[Intro | Chopping Sound | Laughter]
Winter is coming.
Gather round the family.
It's Gimjang time.

[Verse 1]
Piles of cabbage green and white,
Working from the morning light.
Red pepper powder, garlic and ginger,
Spicy scent lingers on the finger.
Grandma mixing with a steady hand,
Tradition of the Korean land.

[Chorus | Choir Harmony]
Gimjang day, labor of love.
Blessings falling from above.
Fermenting slow in the earthen jar.
Best taste in the world by far.
Kimchi! (Spicy!) Kimchi! (Sweet!)

[Verse 2]
Your back might ache, your knees might sore,
But we always make a little more.
Share with the neighbor, share with the friend,
Community spirit that never end.
Boiled pork waiting for the fresh leaf wrap,
Time for a well-deserved nap.

[Bridge | Percussion Break]
(Rhythmic chopping beat)
Mix it well.
Salt and brine.
Taste of time.

[Chorus]
Gimjang day, labor of love.
Fermenting slow in the earthen jar.

[Outro]
See you next winter.
Eat well.
(Laughter fading)
