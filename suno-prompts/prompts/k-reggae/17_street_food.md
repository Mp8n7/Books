[Intro | Sizzling Sound | Steam Hiss]
Pojangmacha!
Open all night.
Come inside, it's warm.

[Verse 1]
Orange tent glowing on the corner street,
Refuge from the cold and the sleet.
Steam rising up from the Odeng pot,
Soup is tasty and the soup is hot.
Tteokbokki bubbling spicy red,
Comfort food for the life we lead.

[Chorus | Heavy Bassline]
Street food rhythm, street food sound.
Best flavor in the underground.
Sundae, Tempura, Kimbap roll.
Food that heals the hungry soul.
Eoseo-oseyo! (Welcome!)

[Verse 2]
Businessman loosen up the tie,
Couple sharing a deep fried fry.
Plastic cup with the warm broth free,
This is where the people be.
Cheap price but the taste is rich,
Scratching that late night hunger itch.

[Bridge | Vendor Shout]
"Hot hot! Coming through!"
"Spicy rice cake here!"
The city never sleeps.

[Chorus]
Street food rhythm, street food sound.
Best flavor in the underground.

[Outro]
One more stick of Odeng.
Put it on the tab.
Goodnight.
```
