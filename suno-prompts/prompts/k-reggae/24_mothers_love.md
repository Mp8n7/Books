[Intro | Wind Chimes | Acoustic Guitar]
Eomma (Mom).
Thank you.
Sarang-hamnida (I love you).

[Verse 1]
Waking up early to cook the rice,
Never thinking of the price.
Packed my lunchbox every day,
Sent me on my school way.
"Study hard, wear a jacket tight,"
Worrying about me day and night.
Janso-ri (Nagging) used to annoy me so,
Now I miss it, now I know.

[Chorus | Gentle Harmony]
Eomma's love, deep as the sea.
Sacrificed everything for me.
Wrinkled hands and silver hair.
Nothing can compare.
Uri Eomma (My Mom), my guiding light.

[Verse 2]
Worked so hard just to make ends meet,
Shoes wore out upon her feet.
Hiding the pain behind a smile,
Walking the extra mile.
Now I am grown, living apart,
But you are always in my heart.
Calling you up on the telephone,
"Did you eat?" is the first tone.

[Bridge | Nylon Guitar Solo]
(Soft and sentimental)
Mian-hae (I'm sorry).
Goma-wo (Thank you).

[Chorus]
Eomma's love, deep as the sea.
Sacrificed everything for me.

[Outro]
Stay healthy, please.
Rae-se (Next life), be my mom again.
I love you.
