[Intro | Thunder Crack | Heavy Rain Sample]
(Echoing delay)
Jangma...
Rain falling...
Falling...

[Verse 1]
Grey sky hanging low over the town,
Water pouring, pouring, pouring down.
Umbrella broken in the wind gust,
City metal turning into rust.
Shoes are wet, socks are soaked,
The sun is hidden, the sky is choked.

[Chorus | Heavy Bass Drop | Melodica]
Monsoon season, heavy on my mind.
Sunlight is so hard to find.
Drip drop, on the window pane.
Lost inside the Korean rain.
(Dub echo: Rain... rain... rain...)

[Verse 2]
Humidity rising, sticky and hot,
Trapped in this small apartment spot.
Pajeon pancake on the frying pan,
Listening to the rhythm of the rain again.
The river rising, the bridges close,
That's just how the season goes.

[Bridge | Space Echo Solo]
(Psychedelic dub effects)
(Thunder rolling in the distance)
Wash it all away.

[Chorus]
Monsoon season, heavy on my mind.
Lost inside the Korean rain.

[Outro]
Until the sun returns.
(Fade into rain sounds)
```
