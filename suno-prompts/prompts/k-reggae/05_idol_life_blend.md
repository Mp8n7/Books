[Intro | Stylish Guitar Riff | Whisper]
(JYP style whisper...)
Reggae summer.
Hey boy.

[Verse 1]
무대 조명 아래 (Under stage lights), perfect every day,
맘 속으론 (Inside my heart), I want to run away.
레게 리듬에 맞춰 (To the reggae rhythm), slow and sweet,
내 몸을 맡겨 (Trust my body), to a different beat.
연습실 거울 속 (In the practice room mirror), reflecting my face,
꿈을 꿔요 (Dreaming) of a tropical place.

[Pre-Chorus | Build Up]
두근두근 (Heart racing)!
달려봐 (Run)!
인형은 되기 싫어 (Don't want to be a doll),
Just want to be myself.

[Chorus | Catchy Pop Melody]
Idol reggae vibe, feeling so cool.
Breaking every single K-pop rule.
하이힐 신고 스캥킹 (Skanking in high heels), singing off-beat.
이 여름 멜로디 (This summer melody) is oh so sweet.
Ooh-whoa-ooh! (Reggae night!)

[Verse 2 (Rap)]
Yeah, check it.
카메라 플래시 (Camera flash), paparazzi snap,
유명세란 덫 (Trap of fame).
But when the bass drops low,
리듬을 타 (Ride the rhythm), flow.
안무는 필요 없어 (No choreo needed), just free style,
꽃길만 걷자 (Let's walk the flower path) for a mile.

[Bridge | Slow Jam]
팬들의 함성 (Fans screaming).
하지만 내 사랑은 (But my love is) not a game.
베이스를 느껴봐 (Feel the bass)...

[Chorus | Key Change]
Idol reggae vibe, feeling so cool!
Breaking every single K-pop rule!

[Outro]
엔딩 포즈 (Ending pose).
(Wink)
사랑해 (I love you).
```
