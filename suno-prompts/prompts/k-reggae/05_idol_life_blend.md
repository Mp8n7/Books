[Intro | Stylish Guitar Riff | Whisper]
(JYP style whisper...)
Reggae summer.
Hey boy.

[Verse 1]
Under the stage lights, perfect every day,
But in my heart, I want to run away.
To a reggae rhythm, slow and sweet,
Moving my body to a different beat.
Practice room mirrors, reflecting my face,
Dreaming of a tropical, faraway place.

[Pre-Chorus | Build Up]
Heartbeat racing (Dugun dugun!)
Music chasing (Run run!)
Don't want to be a doll on a shelf,
Just want to be myself.

[Chorus | Catchy Pop Melody]
Idol reggae vibe, feeling so cool.
Breaking every single K-pop rule.
Skanking in my high heels, singing off-beat.
This summer melody is oh so sweet.
Ooh-whoa-ooh! (Reggae night!)

[Verse 2 (Rap)]
Yeah, check it.
Camera flash, paparazzi snap,
Caught in the fame trap.
But when the bass drops low,
I let the rhythm flow.
No choreography, just free style,
Walking the flowery path for a mile.

[Bridge | Slow Jam]
Fans are screaming my name.
But this love is not a game.
Listen to the bassline...

[Chorus | Key Change]
Idol reggae vibe, feeling so cool!
Breaking every single K-pop rule!

[Outro]
Ending pose.
(Wink)
Saranghae.
