**Lyrics:**
```text
[Intro | Harmonica | Marching Boots]
Ip-dae (Enlistment).
Two years gone.
Gidaryeo-jwo (Wait for me).

[Verse 1]
Shaved my hair off yesterday,
Looking in the mirror, nothing left to say.
Friends are crying at the training gate,
Accepting my duty, accepting my fate.
Choco Pie feels like a taste of gold,
Standing guard in the bitter cold.
Eomma, don't worry, I eat well,
Even though this training feels like hell.

[Chorus | Roots Harmony]
Gun-dae blues, marching in the rain.
Hiding the tears, hiding the pain.
Bear the weight of the nation's gun.
Counting the days 'til I see the sun.
Chung-seong! (Salute!)

[Verse 2]
Writing a letter by the flashlight beam,
My civilian life feels like a dream.
Girlfriend's photo in my pocket deep,
Thinking of her before I sleep.
Snow is falling on the DMZ,
Wishing that I could just be free.
Gukbang-bu (Ministry of Defense) clock goes so slow,
When will the discharge trumpet blow?

[Bridge | Trumpet Solo]
(Melancholic melody)
Bogo shipda (I miss you).
Jeongmal (Really).

[Chorus]
Gun-dae blues, marching in the rain.
Bear the weight of the nation's gun.

[Outro]
Jey-dae (Discharge) is coming.
Hold on.
Chung-seong.
