[Intro | Air Horn | Synth Stab]
(Air horn: Bwah-bwah-bwah!)
Green bottle in my hand!
Seoul city stand up!
One shot! Two shot!

[Verse 1]
Friday night in Hongdae, streets are packed tight,
We gonna drink until the morning light.
Samgyeopsal grilling, smoke in the air,
Pour me another one, I don't care.
Fresh, classic, whatever you got,
Give me the bottle, give me the shot!

[Pre-Chorus]
Jann! (Cheers!)
Bottoms up!
Jann! (Cheers!)
Fill the cup!

[Chorus | Heavy Beat Drop]
Green bottle magic, shaking the room!
Shake it, shake it, shake away the gloom!
One bottle, two bottle, three bottle, four!
Passed out sleeping on the restaurant floor!
Soju! (Hey!) Soju! (Ho!)

[Verse 2]
Mixing with the beer, Somaek bomb drop,
Spinning around like a spinning top.
Karaoke singing, losing my voice,
Making the noise, yeah we making the choice.
Tomorrow headache is a problem for then,
Right now we doing it all again!

[Bridge]
(Slow down tempo)
Everything spinning...
Who is paying the bill?
(Speed up)
RUN!

[Chorus]
Green bottle magic, shaking the room!
One bottle, two bottle, three bottle, four!

[Outro]
Taxi! Taxi!
Ah, forget it.
Walking home.
