[Intro | Subway Chime | Synth Loop]
(Tta-reung!)
This is the inner circle line.
Line Number 2.
Green Line.

[Verse 1]
Gangnam, Yeoksam, Seolleung, Samseong,
Moving to the rhythm ding-dong-ding-dong.
Sports Complex, Jamsil-saenae, Jamsil too,
Crossing the river, water so blue.
Jamsil-naru, Gangbyeon, Guui, Konkuk Univ,
No time to die, no time to live.
Seongsu, Ttukseom, Hanyang Univ, Wangsimni,
Endless circle for you and me.

[Chorus | Hypnotic Beat]
Circle line, round and round.
Green snake underground.
Never stopping, never end.
Around the bend, around the bend.
(Echo: Circle... circle...)

[Verse 2]
Sindang, Dongdaemun History, Euljiro 4,
Doors open, doors close, more and more.
Euljiro 3, Euljiro 1, City Hall,
Passengers leaning on the metal wall.
Chungjeongno, Ahyeon, Ewha Woman's Univ,
Sinchon, Hongik Univ, Hapjeong, give.
Dangsan, Yeongdeungpo-gu Office, Mullae,
Night turns into the day.

[Bridge | Speed Up]
Sindorim (Transfer!)
Daerim, Guro Digital Complex!
Sindaebang, Sillim, Bongcheon, Seoul Nat'l Univ!
Nakseongdae, Sadang, Bangbae, Seocho!
Kyodae!
Back to Gangnam!

[Chorus]
Circle line, round and round.
Green snake underground.

[Outro]
The train is departing.
Next stop is...
Forever.
