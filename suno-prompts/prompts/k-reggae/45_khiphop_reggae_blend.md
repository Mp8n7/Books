[Intro | Air Horn | 808 Slide]
(Yeah!)
K-Hip Hop!
Dancehall!
Show Me The Money!

[Verse 1 | Fast Triplets]
Mic check, one two, I'm the king of the zone,
Sitting on the golden throne all alone.
Chain swinging heavy, Rolex on the wrist,
Haters on the list, yeah they getting dismissed.
Spitting fire like a dragon, hear the roar,
Level up, level up, high score.
From the basement to the penthouse suite,
Murdering the rhythm and killing the beat.

[Chorus | Heavy Trap Beat]
Flexing on the rhythm, flexing on the rhyme.
Yeah it is my time, yeah it is my prime.
K-Hip Hop Reggae, brand new sound.
Shaking up the underground.
Swag! (Swag!) Swag! (Swag!)

[Verse 2]
Hongdae playground cypher, started from the dirt,
Put in the work until the body hurt.
Now I'm on the TV screen, shining bright,
Living the good life every single night.
Auto-tune melody, dripping with sauce,
I am the boss, yeah I am the boss.
Copycats trying to steal my flow,
But they don't know, yeah they don't know.

[Bridge | Half-Time Breakdown]
(Slow heavy beat)
Respect the game.
Respect the name.
Real recognize real.

[Chorus]
Flexing on the rhythm, flexing on the rhyme.
Yeah it is my time, yeah it is my prime.

[Outro]
Drop the mic.
Peace out.
(Explosion sound)
