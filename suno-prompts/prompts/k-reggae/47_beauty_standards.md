[Intro | Camera Shutter | Mirror Crack]
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of them all?
Check the filter.

[Verse 1]
Skip the dinner, eat a salad leaf,
Hunger is the constant thief.
V-line jaw and double eyelid cut,
Keep the mouth tightly shut.
Gangnam Unnie walking down the street,
Plastic perfection from head to feet.
Standard beauty, clone attack,
There is no turning back.

[Chorus | Upbeat Melody]
Beauty standard, breaking the soul.
Losing the self, losing control.
Fake face, fake smile, fake life too.
What happened to the real you?
Pretty? (Ugly?) Pretty? (Ugly?)

[Verse 2]
Photoshopped picture on the profile screen,
Living inside a magazine.
Diet pill and whitening cream,
Chasing the impossible dream.
Doctor saying "Fix this, fix that,"
Cutting away the baby fat.
Look in the mirror, stranger stares,
Nobody really cares.

[Bridge | Spoken Word]
You are beautiful.
Just the way you are.
Don't change.

[Chorus]
Beauty standard, breaking the soul.
Losing the self, losing control.

[Outro]
Delete the app.
Eat the cake.
Be free.
```
