[Intro | Wind Blowing | Leaves Rustling]
Autumn wind.
Danpung (Maple leaves).
Change is coming.

[Verse 1]
Green turns to yellow, yellow to red,
Summer is sleeping in its winter bed.
Ginkgo leaves falling like golden rain,
Covering the street and covering the pain.
Cool breeze blowing through the sweater wool,
The mountain side is looking full.
Sky is high and the horses are fat (Cheon-go-ma-bi),
Wearing my favorite autumn hat.

[Chorus | Gentle Melody]
Autumn leaves, dancing on the ground.
Colors of the season all around.
Red and gold, painting the view.
Falling in love with the season and you.
Danpung... (Falling...)

[Verse 2]
Walking the stone wall path today,
Watching the colors fade to grey.
Capture the moment before it goes,
Before the coming of the winter snows.
Hot tea warming up cold hands,
Beauty spreading across the lands.
Shortest season, sweetest taste,
Let's enjoy it without haste.

[Bridge | Flute Solo]
(Melancholic autumn melody)
Falling down.
Turning round.
Gone too soon.

[Chorus]
Autumn leaves, dancing on the ground.
Colors of the season all around.

[Outro]
See you next year.
Winter is here.
(Wind blows stronger)
