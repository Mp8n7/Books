[Intro | Doo-Wop Harmony]
(Ooh-wah... Cheotsarang...)
Do you remember?
Long time ago.

[Verse 1]
School uniform, yellow name tag,
Carrying a heavy book bag.
Passed a note in the math class,
Watching the slow hours pass.
Meeting at the playground swing,
Giving you a plastic ring.
Rain was falling on that day,
When you moved far away.

[Chorus | Sweet Harmony]
First love, never forget.
No anger, no regret.
Cheotsarang, pure and true.
I am still missing you.
(Missing you... missing you...)

[Verse 2]
Tteokbokki shop after school,
Acting like a silly fool.
Radio playing our favorite song,
Where did the time go wrong?
Now I am old, hair is grey,
But I remember yesterday.
Your smile is painted in my mind,
A treasure I will always find.

[Bridge | Piano & Guitar]
(Vintage melody)
Like a movie scene.
Fading but clean.

[Chorus]
First love, never forget.
No anger, no regret.
Cheotsarang, pure and true.

[Outro]
(Harmonies fading)
Goodbye my love.
Be happy.
(Ooh-wah...)
```
