[Intro | Footsteps | Whistling]
Olle Trail!
Let's walk!
Hana, dul, set, net (1, 2, 3, 4)!

[Verse 1]
Follow the ribbon, blue and orange tag,
Water bottle in my little bag.
Walking path winding by the sea,
This is the place I want to be.
Stone walls (Doldam) guiding me along,
Singing a happy walking song.
Hello to the pony (Ganse) by the road,
Putting down my heavy load.

[Chorus | Ska Upbeat]
Walking the Olle, step by step.
Building up the energy and the pep.
Jeju Island, round and round.
Listen to the nature sound.
Olle! (Olle!) Olle! (Olle!)

[Verse 2]
Route number 7, scenic view,
Sky and ocean matching blue.
Waves are crashing on the rocky shore,
Walking miles and wanting more.
Take a stamp in the passport book,
Stop for a moment and take a look.
Slow travel is the way to go,
Letting the natural feelings flow.

[Bridge | Brass Solo]
(Happy trumpet melody)
Keep moving!
Don't stop!
Almost there!

[Chorus]
Walking the Olle, step by step.
Building up the energy and the pep.

[Outro]
Finish line.
Good job!
Rest now.
(Ocean waves)
