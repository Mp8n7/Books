**Lyrics:**

[Intro | Wind Chimes | Piano]
Namsan Tower.
High above the city.
Just you and me.

[Verse 1]
Cable car rising to the peak,
Finding the happiness we seek.
City lights twinkling down below,
Watching the Seoul night start to glow.
Holding a padlock in my hand,
Making a promise, making a stand.
Write our names with a marker pen,
Together now and together then.

[Chorus | Sweet Harmony]
Lock of love, click it tight.
Sealing our love on this starry night.
Throw the key into the trees.
Forever bound, never free.
Namsan love...

[Verse 2]
Thousands of locks on the metal fence,
Love that is pure and love that is dense.
Rusty ones from years ago,
Stories that only the lovers know.
Cold wind blowing but we are warm,
Safe together from any storm.
Snapshot taken to keep the view,
My heart is locked on you.

[Bridge | Guitar Solo]
(Gentle melody)
Forever.
Yaksok (Promise).

[Chorus]
Lock of love, click it tight.
Sealing our love on this starry night.

[Outro]
Don't look down.
Look at me.
Sarang-hae.
```
