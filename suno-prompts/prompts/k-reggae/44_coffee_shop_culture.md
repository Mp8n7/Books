[Intro | Coffee Grinder | Pouring]
Good morning.
Coffee aroma.
Ah-Ah (Iced Americano).

[Verse 1]
One cafe on every street corner block,
Open doors around the clock.
"Iced Americano, take out please,"
Even in the winter freeze.
Bitter taste waking up the brain,
Sunshine following the rain.
Laptop open, Wi-Fi strong,
Sipping coffee all day long.

[Chorus | Relaxed Groove]
Coffee shop culture, daily routine.
Running on the caffeine machine.
Bitter and cold, sweet and hot.
Giving it everything I got.
Ka-pe-in (Caffeine)!

[Verse 2]
Latte art, heart in the foam,
Cafe is my second home.
Meeting friends, gossip and chat,
Wondering where the time is at.
Buzzing feeling in my veins,
Washing away the sleep and pains.
Point card stamp, one more to go,
Free drink waiting in the row.

[Bridge | Melodica Solo]
(Relaxed melody)
Sip by sip.
Drip by drip.
Awake.

[Chorus]
Coffee shop culture, daily routine.
Running on the caffeine machine.

[Outro]
One more shot.
Espresso.
Wide awake.
(Cup set down)
```
