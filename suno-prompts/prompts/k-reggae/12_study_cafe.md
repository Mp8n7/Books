[Intro | White Noise Machine | Pencil Writing]
(Shh...)
Focus.
Page 101.

[Verse 1]
Silence is golden, silence is key,
Just the sound of the pencil and me.
Coffee in the tumbler, keeping me awake,
How much knowledge can one mind take?
Students sleeping with their heads on the book,
I steal a glance with a quiet look.

[Chorus | Soft Rhodes Chords]
Dokseosil vibe, quiet and low.
Watching the hours moving so slow.
Dreaming of the future, dreaming of the test.
Putting my memory to the quest.
(Whisper: Study... study...)

[Verse 2]
Laptop humming a gentle song,
Been sitting in this chair for way too long.
Slippers sliding on the wooden floor,
Someone walking to the exit door.
Post-it notes stuck on the wall,
Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.

[Bridge | Page Turning Sound]
Turn the page.
Next chapter.
Don't give up.

[Chorus]
Dokseosil vibe, quiet and low.
Dreaming of the future, dreaming of the test.

[Outro]
Five more minutes.
Then I go home.
(Soft hum)
```
