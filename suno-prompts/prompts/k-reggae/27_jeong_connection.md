[Intro | Nyabinghi Drums | Heavy Bass]
Jeong.
It is not just love.
It is deeper.
Listen.

[Verse 1]
Invisible thread connecting you and me,
Like the roots of a giant tree.
Time passes, seasons change,
But the feeling is never strange.
Sharing food, sharing pain,
Walking together in the sun and rain.
More than friends, more than kin,
It is the spirit deep within.

[Chorus | Deep Harmony]
Jeong is the bond that never breaks.
Give and take, whatever it takes.
Sticky love, hard to define.
Your heart is connected to mine.
Korean soul, ancient way.
Jeong stays with us every day.

[Verse 2]
Even if we fight and hate,
We are bound by a common fate.
Mi-un Jeong (Hateful affection) creates a tie,
Cannot say a clean goodbye.
Sharing the last piece of the cake,
Sacrifice for the other's sake.
Look in the eye, understand the soul,
Together we are making it whole.

[Bridge | Organ Bubble]
(Spoken Word)
It grows with time.
Like fermentation.
Deep. Complex.
Eternal.

[Chorus]
Jeong is the bond that never breaks.
Give and take, whatever it takes.

[Outro]
Feel the Jeong.
Connect.
One spirit.
(Drum fade)
