[Intro | Water Splashing | Exhale]
Ahhhhh....
Jjimjilbang heat.
Relax your body.

[Verse 1]
Sheep head towel on my head,
Face is turning rosy red.
Baked egg cracking on the skull,
Life is never, ever dull.
Ice cold Sikhye, sweet and rice,
This feeling is paradise.

[Chorus | Steady Bass Pulse]
Sweat it out, let it flow.
In the sauna, time is slow.
Hot room, ice room, salt room too.
Healing me and healing you.
Jjimjilbang dub... (Echo: Dub... dub...)

[Verse 2]
Lying on the heated floor,
Don't want to leave here anymore.
Scrub the worry from the skin,
Cleanse the stress from within.
Grandpa sleeping, snoring loud,
Lost inside the steam cloud.

[Bridge | Bamboo Flute]
(Meditative melody)
Heat rising.
Cool down.
Balance.

[Chorus]
Sweat it out, let it flow.
In the sauna, time is slow.

[Outro]
Sleeping mat.
Goodnight.
(Snoring sound)
```
