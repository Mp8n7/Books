[Intro | Sewing Machine | Crowd Noise]
Dongdaemun!
Night market!
Gol-la gol-la! (Pick, pick!)

[Verse 1]
Midnight shopping, sleep is for the weak,
Fashion trend is what we seek.
DDP glowing like a spaceship silver,
Cold night wind make me shiver.
Piles of clothes on the wholesale floor,
Buying less but wanting more.
"How much is this?" "Ggakka-juseyo!" (Discount please!)
Business flowing like the breeze.

[Chorus | Heavy Bassline]
Dongdaemun hustle, never stop.
Climb to the fashion mountain top.
Plastic bags heavy in my hand.
Busiest market in the land.
Fashion! (Style!) Fashion! (Style!)

[Verse 2]
Motorcycles carrying the heavy bale,
Everything is always on sale.
Designers sketching, factories sew,
Fastest fashion in the world, you know.
Fish cake soup on the street side stall,
Energy needed to see it all.
Neon lights burning the retina,
From Seoul to China to Argentina.

[Bridge | Synth Horns]
(Chaotic rhythm)
Cheap price!
Good quality!
Best design!

[Chorus]
Dongdaemun hustle, never stop.
Climb to the fashion mountain top.

[Outro]
Sun is coming up.
Time to sleep.
Fashion dreams.
