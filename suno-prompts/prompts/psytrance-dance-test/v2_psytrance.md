# Psytrance Dance - V5 Prompt

**Reasoning:** To achieve a 'psytrance that really makes you dance', I will focus on a high-energy, driving 'Full-On' Psytrance style. I will use a high Weirdness (0.6) to encourage trippy, unexpected textures, but a high Style Influence (0.7) to ensure it stays strictly within the genre. The lyrics will use specific V5 structural tags like [Drop] and [Arpeggiator] to control the energy flow. I will exclude 'vocals' and 'pop' to keep it underground and hypnotic, though a few robotic spoken words are acceptable in the genre.
