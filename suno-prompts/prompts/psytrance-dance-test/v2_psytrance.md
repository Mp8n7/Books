<summary>AI Analysis</summary>

**Reasoning:**
To achieve a 'psytrance that really makes you dance', I will focus on a high-energy, driving 'Full-On' Psytrance style. Crucially, I will incorporate **V1 Magic Words** like "phase-coherent low end" and "clean punch" to ensure the production quality is professional and not just generic AI noise. I will use a high Weirdness (0.6) to encourage trippy, unexpected textures, but a high Style Influence (0.7) to ensure it stays strictly within the genre. The lyrics will use specific V5 structural tags like [Drop] and [Arpeggiator] to control the energy flow.
