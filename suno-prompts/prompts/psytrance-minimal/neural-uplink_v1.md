# Neural Uplink - Suno Prompt

## Evaluation (Pre-Generation)
*   **Prompt Quality**: Strong use of technical electronic terms (wavetable, squelch, sidechain) to avoid generic "techno" sound.
*   **Lyrics**: Minimal, as requested. Avoids "AI Slop" by sticking to repetitive vocal chops rather than narrative verses.
*   **Score Prediction**: 8/10. The structure is solid for Psytrance.

## Final Prompt

**Parameters:**
*   **Weirdness:** 40% (Bumped up for High Energy/Electronic)
*   **Style Influence:** 60% (Adhere to clean production standards)
