# Mongolian Winter Bass - Suno Prompt

## Evaluation (Pre-Generation)
*   **Concept**: High-speed Psytrance (160 BPM) fused with the deep, guttural sounds of Tuvan throat singing and the thick, punchy low-end texture of Brazilian Bass.
*   **Lyrics**: Minimal, focusing on the harshness and majesty of winter.
*   **Score Prediction**: 9.5/10. The contrast between high-speed beats and slow, drone-like throat singing creates a massive atmospheric tension.

## Final Prompt

**Parameters:**
*   **Weirdness:** 65% (Experimental fusion of disparate genres)
*   **Style Influence:** 60% (Allowing the blend to breathe between the speed and the vocal style)
