# Example Suno Prompts

Here are some example prompts to get you started.

## Electronic / Synthwave

> A driving synthwave track with pulsating basslines, neon aesthetics, and a nostalgic 80s feel. Upbeat and energetic.

## Lo-Fi Hip Hop

> Chill lo-fi hip hop beat with a dusty piano sample, light rain background noise, and a steady, relaxed drum beat. Perfect for studying.

## Orchestral / Epic

> A grand orchestral piece building from a quiet cello solo to a massive climax with full strings, brass, and choir. Heroic and inspiring.

## Acoustic Folk

> Gentle acoustic guitar fingerpicking with soft, breathy vocals. Lyrics about autumn leaves and returning home. Intimate and warm production.
