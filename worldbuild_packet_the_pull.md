# WORLDBUILD PACKET: THE PULL

**Logline:** In a world where every human can rewind time by 30 seconds—but no one knows anyone else can—five specialists in 2025 independently discover the truth and collide in Las Vegas, igniting a shadow war over whether to reveal the secret that would shatter civilization.

---

## I. THE NATURE OF THE PULL

### The Core Power

Every human being on Earth possesses the ability to rewind time. They have possessed it since birth. No one knows why. No one knows when it started. It simply *is*.

**The Pull** — The act of rewinding time backward.

When a person Pulls:
- The entire universe rewinds—every atom, every photon, every recorded device
- Only the Puller retains their memories of the erased timeline
- There are no exceptions. Nothing escapes. Everything resets.
- The Puller arrives in their past body, with their present mind

### The Mechanics

| Parameter | Baseline | Modified By |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Window** | 30 seconds minimum | Focus (extends) / Panic (shrinks involuntarily) |
| **Cooldown** | 60 seconds | Focus (shortens) / Panic (lengthens) |
| **Memory** | Puller retains all | Cannot be transferred or shared |
| **Physical State** | Fully rewinds | Body returns to past condition |

### Absolute Rules

1. **Everything Rewinds** — Bodies, objects, recordings, weather, technology. No exceptions exist. If someone tells you they found a loophole, they're wrong.

2. **Only The Puller Remembers** — The sole exception to total rewind. Your consciousness persists. Your memories cross the gap. Nothing else does.

3. **Minimum 30 Seconds** — You cannot choose to rewind less. The Pull is 30 seconds or more. If you lose focus, you might involuntarily Pull shorter, but you can never *choose* a partial rewind.

4. **Cooldown Is Soul-Bound** — Your cooldown ticks in your subjective experience, regardless of what happens to the timeline. If someone else Pulls and rewrites reality around you, your cooldown keeps running from your perspective.

5. **No Sensing** — You cannot detect when someone else Pulls. Ever. You cannot sense their cooldown. You cannot feel the timeline change. If they rewind around you, you simply don't remember—because in the new timeline, it never happened.

---

## II. THE FOCUS SPECTRUM

### What Focus Means

Focus isn't mere concentration. It's **cognitive bandwidth under temporal stress**.

During a Pull, the mind must:
- Hold memory of the erased timeline
- Re-enter an earlier moment without disorientation
- Make new decisions while remembering old outcomes
- Suppress the paradox vertigo
- Act naturally so observers notice nothing

Most people do this instinctively and sloppily. The gifted do it with precision.

### The Spectrum

| User Type | Window | Cooldown | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Panicked civilian | 15-20 sec | 90 sec | Fear shrinks capability |
| Calm baseline | 30 sec | 60 sec | Default human state |
| Trained user | 35-45 sec | 45-50 sec | Practice and discipline |
| Prodigy/Savant | 50-60 sec | 30-40 sec | Rare cognitive gift |
| Near-death clarity | Up to 90 sec | Unchanged | Temporary, unreliable |

### What Improves Focus

- Innate processing speed and working memory
- Emotional regulation training
- Meditation and mindfulness practice
- Combat exposure (staying calm under fire)
- Certain neurotypes (hyperfocus-capable individuals)
- Chemical enhancement (temporary boost, long-term damage)

### What Degrades Focus

- Fear and panic
- Physical pain
- Exhaustion
- Intoxication
- Emotional flooding
- First exposure to genuine mortal danger

## III. THE SECRET HISTORY

### Why Everyone Kept It Hidden

Consider the discovery from any individual's perspective:

**Childhood (Age 5-10):**
You fall. You scrape your knee. Suddenly you're standing again, *before* the fall. You don't tell anyone. It sounds crazy. You think you imagined it. You do it again. And again. You learn to keep quiet.

**Adolescence:**
You use it constantly. Unsay the embarrassing thing. Ace the test by rewinding mistakes. Dodge the punch you saw coming the first time. You assume you're special. Blessed. Cursed. Chosen. You never find proof anyone else has it—because there *can't* be proof.

**Adulthood:**
You've built a framework. God gave you this gift. Or you're a mutant. Or reality is a simulation and you found a glitch. You've never met another. Asking would mean revealing yourself. The silence is mutual, global, and absolute.

### Why It Never Leaked

- No physical evidence persists through a Pull
- Cannot be recorded (recordings rewind with everything else)
- Every "witness" to a Pull doesn't remember it
- Users who talked were dismissed as mentally ill
- Revealing the power means risking everything—for what?

### The Unspoken Global Pact

Eight billion people. Eight billion secrets. Each one certain they're alone.

## IV. THE 2025 REVELATION

### The Catalyst: Statistical Impossibilities

By 2025, certain patterns became undeniable—if you knew where to look.

- Insurance actuaries noticed clients with impossible survival rates
- Psychologists observed patients with uncanny "intuition"
- Casinos flagged players whose luck defied mathematics
- Fighters encountered opponents who moved *before* attacks landed

Most dismissed these anomalies. Five did not.

### The Five Specialists

Each developed a unique method to identify other users, based on their area of expertise. Each method exploits the one thing that *does* persist: **behavioral traces of foreknowledge**.

---

## V. THE SPECIALISTS

### 1. SIENNA VANCE — The Actuary

**Background:** Insurance fraud investigator. Fifteen years analyzing miraculous survival claims.

**The Fundamental Misunderstanding:** Sienna believes she's identifying rare individuals with a special ability. She's wrong. Everyone in her database can Pull. Her statistical flags don't identify users—they identify *careless* users who Pull frequently enough, or in documented-enough situations, that the pattern becomes visible.

**Discovery:** One client survived three "certain death" car accidents. Five chemical exposures with no health effects. His actuarial profile was mathematically absurd—survival odds in the trillionths. She found hundreds of similar profiles.

**Method: Statistical Profiling + High-Stakes Observation**
- Builds database of individuals whose survival/success rates defy probability
- Observes suspects during high-stakes situations (insurance interviews, claims processes)
- Watches for slips followed by too-smooth recoveries
- Cross-references testimony across interviews—suspiciously perfect consistency is a flag

**Specialty:** Pattern recognition across populations. Can identify *probable* users before meeting them. The group's strategic database.

**Weakness:** Her tests only catch careless users. Disciplined users who Pull rarely and privately never appear in her data.

**The Irony:** She could flag literally anyone if she watched them long enough.

---

### 2. DECLAN CROSS — The Mentalist

**Background:** Former "psychic" medium, high-end con artist specializing in cold readings for the ultra-wealthy.

**Discovery:** Some marks responded to his fishing attempts with reactions that were *too* smooth—no fumbling, no physiological tells, no emotional arc. Like they'd already heard what he was going to say and had time to compose themselves. Because they had—in a timeline they'd erased after slipping.

**Method: Fishing for Slips**
- Builds false rapport through cold reading techniques
- Creates "pressure points"—leading questions, adjacent details, emotional provocations designed to invite accidental revelations
- Watches for slips: involuntary glances, half-sentences, names they shouldn't volunteer
- If they're a user and they slipped, they'll Pull to undo the mistake
- Declan can't remember the erased timeline, but he reads the *aftermath*: responses that are too clean, too prepared, missing the normal fumbling and emotional arc
- Key tell: the "settling" micro-expression—a split-second reorientation visible right after a Pull

**Specialty:** Reading the absence of authentic reactions. Detecting when someone has "handled" a moment too smoothly.

**Weakness:** Only catches users who slip. Disciplined users who never make revealing mistakes won't trigger the test. High false-negative rate.

---

### 3. MATEO REYES — The Magician

**Background:** World-class close-up magician. Casino security consultant. Has fooled audiences for thirty years.

**The Fundamental Misunderstanding:** Mateo believes he's identifying rare individuals with a special ability. He's wrong. Every audience member can Pull. The "normal" spectators who watch with genuine surprise aren't non-users—they just don't care enough about a magic trick to burn a Pull.

**Discovery:** Some spectators' reactions felt *off*—too smooth, too controlled, like a performance rather than a genuine response. He realized they'd seen the moment before and were acting out a reaction.

**Method: Reading Performance Quality**

Mateo's original trick-hint-trap failed because almost no one cares enough about catching a magic trick to Pull. He now focuses on reading *authentic vs. performed reactions*:

- Genuine reactions show micro-expression cascades, verbal fumbling, delayed processing
- Performed reactions are too smooth, too immediate, too "selected"
- For higher-confidence testing, he adds stakes (bets, challenges) or blends mentalism to create emotional pressure points where slips become more likely

**Specialty:** Real-time social reading. Can detect "performed" quality in any interaction, not just magic. The group's social confirmer.

**Weakness:** Only works if target slips and then performs their cover badly. Disciplined users with good poker faces pass completely.

**The Irony:** His tests don't detect "users"—they detect users who are careless AND bad actors.

---

### 4. WEI "GHOST" SHEN — The Hitman

**Background:** Bareknuckle fighter from Kowloon. Enforcer for the 14K Triad. Has killed more men than he can remember.

**The Fundamental Misunderstanding:** Wei believes he's identifying rare individuals with a special ability. He's wrong. Every target he's ever faced could Pull. The difference is whether they use it—and whether they're good enough to survive even with it.

**Discovery:** Some targets were impossible. One man dodged a killing blow from behind, in darkness, with zero warning. Not reflexes. Foreknowledge. Wei started paying attention.

**Method: The Undodgeable Strike**

The physics are simple:
- Human reaction time: ~250 milliseconds
- Wei's strike, commitment to contact: ~150 milliseconds
- You literally *cannot* see it coming and move in time—unless you already know it's coming

*The Tell: Wrong Timing*
- Reaction dodge: movement starts AFTER the attack
- Foreknowledge dodge: movement starts BEFORE or SIMULTANEOUS
- The body moves too early. They're not reacting. They're remembering.

**Confirmation:** Multiple impossible dodges. Everyone gets one lucky escape. Nobody gets five.

**What He's Actually Detecting:** Not "users vs. non-users"—everyone is a user. He's detecting people who Pull during combat vs. people who don't (usually because they're already dead before they can react).

**Specialty:** Real-time combat detection. Immediate results. The only method with genuinely life-or-death stakes.

**Weakness:** Requires genuine lethal intent. Sparring won't trigger the response. Also: targets who die before they can Pull never reveal themselves.

---

### 5. ELIJAH "ELI" MOON — The Poker Player

**Background:** Professional high-stakes player. Banned from six major casinos. Win rate defies all mathematical models.

**The Fundamental Misunderstanding:** Eli believes he's identifying rare individuals with a special ability. He's wrong. Every player at his tables can Pull. The difference isn't *having* the ability—it's whether they use it for poker. He's been beating people who had the same edge he did but chose not to use it.

**Discovery:** Himself first—he'd rewind bad hands so often it became automatic. Then he noticed others at the highest levels with identical statistical profiles. The same impossible luck. The same tells.

**Method: Recognizing Natural Trap Hands**

Eli can't control card distribution, so he doesn't *construct* trap hands—he recognizes them when they naturally occur:
- Situations where all visible information says "bet big"
- But hidden cards guarantee loss
- Normal player: bets correctly, loses
- User who Pulled: folds "inexplicably"

**Confirmation:** One weird fold = instinct. Pattern of weird folds on natural traps = rewinding.

**Secondary: Cooldown Estimation**
- Tracks when opponents make "impossible" plays
- Infers cooldown cycles from behavior patterns
- Not sensing—guessing based on observable decisions

**Specialty:** Pattern analysis. Statistical profiling of win rates. The group's skeptic who trusts data over intuition.

**Weakness:** Only catches users who Pull at the poker table. Many users don't—because they're disciplined, or don't care enough about poker losses, or understand the exposure risk.

**The Irony:** He could confirm literally anyone as a user—if he could create high enough stakes that they'd Pull to avoid the loss.

---

## THE TRAGIC IRONY

### What The Specialists Believe

Each of the five specialists believes they're identifying rare individuals—maybe 0.001% of the population—who possess a unique ability. They think they're finding needles in a haystack. They've built their entire framework around the assumption that "users" are exceptional and "normal people" are the baseline.

### The Truth

**Everyone is a user. 100% of the human population.**

The specialists aren't detecting ability. They're detecting *behavior*.

Their tests don't distinguish "users" from "non-users"—they distinguish:
- Careless users from careful users
- Users who Pull for low stakes from users who don't
- Users who perform their cover-ups poorly from users who perform them well
- Users who happen to slip during observation from users who don't

A "normal person" who passes their tests isn't someone without the power. They're someone who:
- Didn't Pull during that particular observation
- Is more disciplined about when they use the ability
- Has a higher threshold for what justifies burning a Pull
- Got lucky (didn't slip when it would have been visible)

### The Implications

**Their database isn't a list of rare users.** It's a list of careless users—people who Pull frequently enough, or publicly enough, that patterns emerge.

**Every "normal person" they've dismissed could be confirmed** if the stakes were high enough. Put anyone in a genuinely life-threatening situation, and they'll Pull. Test anyone with enough consequence, and eventually they'll slip.

**Their entire framework is wrong.** They think they're building a coalition of exceptional humans. In reality, they're just the five people who figured out the secret while being arrogant enough to assume they're special.

### When They Learn The Truth

The moment of revelation—when the specialists realize everyone has the Pull—will shatter their worldview:

- Sienna's statistical models become meaningless. She wasn't finding users; she was finding *visible* users.
- Declan's life as a "psychic" con artist takes on new dimensions. Everyone he ever conned could have Pulled. They just didn't.
- Mateo's thirty-year guilt about "cheating" at magic dissolves—and reforms. Everyone could cheat. Most chose not to.
- Wei's nine kills weren't murders of "his own kind." They were just murders. Of people like everyone else.
- Eli's poker career was never a special edge. It was just willingness to use something everyone had.

**The question becomes:** If everyone can Pull, why does anyone ever fail? Why does anyone ever die? Why do consequences exist at all?

The answer: **Because most people don't Pull for most things.** The power is universal, but the willingness to use it is not.

## VI. COMBAT DYNAMICS

### The Fundamental Problem

You cannot sense when your opponent Pulls. You cannot see their cooldown. You are fighting blind against an invisible resource.

**Victory requires inference.**

### Observable Signs of Recent Pull

| Sign | Possible Meaning |
|------|------------------|
| Impossible dodge | They probably rewound |
| Perfectly countered your plan | They've seen it before |
| Sudden behavior shift for no reason | They just Pulled and changed approach |
| Physical symptoms (tremor, nosebleed) without exertion | Heavy Pull usage |
| Unnatural calm facing death | They have Pulls banked |
| Reckless aggression | They know they can undo mistakes |
| Overcautious stalling | They're in cooldown, buying time |

### The Combat Phases

**Phase 1: Probing**
- Test reactions with non-lethal pressure
- Look for impossible responses
- Vary your patterns—don't give useful data

**Phase 2: Forcing**
- Escalate to attacks requiring a Pull to survive
- Each impossible survival = one Pull burned
- Count their miracles

**Phase 3: Calculating**
- Estimate their cooldown based on observed Pulls
- Estimate recovery based on elapsed time
- Find the window where they *should* be vulnerable

**Phase 4: The Committed Strike**
- Attack with full lethality when you believe they're in cooldown
- If wrong: you might die
- If right: they can't undo it

**Phase 5: Burnout Reckoning**
- Extended combat exhausts focus
- Cooldowns lengthen, windows shrink
- Eventually, someone can't Pull anymore
- Pure skill decides the end

### The Unpredictability Principle

**A Pull only gives useful information if your opponent repeats their behavior.**

If you rewind and they do the same thing, you win. If you rewind and they do something random, your foreknowledge is worthless.

**Elite users cultivate deliberate chaos.** They randomize approaches, timing, methods. They make choices even *they* can't predict.

### The Stagger

Breaking combat rhythm deliberately:

**The Early Kill**
- Strike immediately after arriving from a Pull
- Forces opponent to Pull at an unexpected moment
- Desynchronizes your cooldown cycles

**The Delayed Kill**
- Wait longer than expected before striking
- Your cooldown recovers while you stall
- When they Pull in response, you're closer to ready than they expect

---

## VII. THE SLOW KILL

### The Assassin's Solution

Direct combat against another user is dangerous. The safe approach: **kill them outside their Window.**

If you poison someone 5 minutes before they realize it, their 30-second Pull can't reach the poisoning. They die.

### The Calculus

| Kill Setup Time | Required Window | Escape Odds |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 minute ago | ~60 seconds | Medium (trained users might reach) |
| 5 minutes ago | ~300 seconds | Very low |
| 1 hour ago | ~3600 seconds | Essentially zero |
| Days/weeks ago | N/A | Impossible to escape |

### Methods

- **Fast poison:** 1-5 minutes before symptom. Risky; clarity might reach it.
- **Slow poison:** Hours to days. Very safe.
- **Radiation exposure:** Days to weeks. Unrewindable.
- **Sabotaged vehicle:** Variable timing. Tune to safety margin.
- **Contractual/legal ruin:** Weeks to months. Completely unrewindable.

### The Counter

How to survive slow kills:

1. Detect the trap early—before it's outside your Window
2. Maintain low stress—maximize available extension
3. Train for clarity—increase odds of death-focus over death-panic
4. Paranoia—assume everything is poisoned, sabotaged, trapped

Elite users live as survivalists. They eat only food they've watched prepared. They check vehicles obsessively. They never sleep in the same place twice.

## VIII. THE INFINITE DUEL

### When It Happens

Two equally matched users with identical focus, fighting directly.

```
T=0     A kills B
        B Pulls to T=-30
        
T=-30   B kills A
        A Pulls to T=-60
        
T=-60   A kills B
        B Pulls to T=-90
        
...the timeline spirals backward...
```

Neither can land a permanent blow. Each kill is undone. Each counter is countered.

### The Spiral

The timeline doesn't loop—it regresses. Each Pull pushes everything further into the past.

After enough Pulls:
- Hours of soul-time = minutes of timeline regression
- Days of soul-time = hours of regression
- Years of soul-time = months of regression

The fighters grow **younger**. Their bodies rewind with the timeline. But their minds accumulate experience.

### The Terminus

Eventually, the combatants spiral back to childhood.

Two ancient warrior-minds in the bodies of children. 
Unable to physically kill each other.
The duel ends—not because anyone won, but because murder became mechanically impossible.

### The Aftermath

What do you do when you've fought the same person for subjective decades—and now you're both five years old?

Wait twenty years and resume? Find a way to kill a child with a child's body? Or finally, after endless murder... stop?

The Infinite Duel is the rarest and most horrifying outcome of user combat. Legends whisper of "The Two Who Went Back." No one knows if they're still fighting, still waiting, or finally at peace.

---

## IX. SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS

### The Current State (2025)

- **Population aware:** ~6-12 individuals globally have figured out the truth
- **General public:** Completely unaware
- **Institutions:** No government, corporation, or organization knows
- **Detection:** Impossible without specialized testing methods

### If The Secret Breaks

The revelation would shatter civilization:

**Trust Collapses**
- Every conversation might be rehearsed
- Every apology might be calculated
- Romance becomes suspect
- Authenticity becomes impossible to verify

**Law Fails**
- How do you prosecute crimes that were rewound?
- How do you trust testimony?
- How do you enforce contracts?

**Power Shifts**
- Those with superior focus become de facto rulers
- Training centers become the new arms race
- Slow kill expertise becomes the most valuable skill

**Existential Questions**
- Which version of events is "real"?
- Do erased timelines matter morally?
- Are the people in rewound timelines... murdered?

### The Choice

The five specialists, once they find each other, face a decision:

**Reveal:** Tell the world. Shatter the illusion. Let humanity adapt or destroy itself.

**Conceal:** Keep the secret. Build a shadow network. Manage the power from the darkness.

**Weaponize:** Sell the knowledge. Train armies. Become the new gods.

**Destroy:** Find a way to eliminate the power. If it can be done. If it should be done.

*End of Worldbuild Packet: THE PULL*
